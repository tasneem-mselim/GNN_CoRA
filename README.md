# Cora Node Classification Challenge (GCN-Based)

## 📌 Overview

This repository hosts the **Cora Node Classification Challenge**, a graph machine learning competition based on the **Cora citation network**. Participants are required to design and train **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** models to classify scientific papers into research topics using node features and graph structure.

## Difficulty level
This implementation does not follow the standard Cora benchmark. 

To increase task difficulty, Gaussian noise (σ = 0.4) has been applied to the node features.

## 🧠 Task Description

* Each node represents a **scientific publication**.
* Edges represent **citation relationships** between papers.
* Each node belongs to **one of 7 classes**.

### Objective

Train a model that accurately predicts the class labels of **unlabeled test nodes**, using:

* Node features
* Graph connectivity

## 📊 Dataset Details


The dataset is derived from the **Cora citation network**.

| Property      | Value                |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| Nodes         | 2,708                |
| Edges         | 5,429 (undirected)   |
| Node features | 1,433 (bag-of-words) |
| Classes       | 7                    |

### Data Splits (Standard Cora Protocol)

* **Training nodes**: 140 (20 per class)
* **Validation nodes**: 500 
* **Test nodes**: 1,000 (labels hidden)

---

### Public Files:
These files are available in the data/ folder for participants:

edge_index.csv — adjacency information of the graph (edges between nodes)

x.csv — node features

y_train.csv — labels for the training nodes

y_val.csv — labels for validation nodes

test_ID _ id of testing nodes


### Private Files:
- Test_label → Hidden ground-truth data used for automatic evaluation

## 📝 How to Submit Your Results

Follow the steps below to submit your predictions to the competition leaderboard.

---

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Forked Repository

### Step 3: Go to the Submission Folder

### Step 4: Prepare the submission .csv locally 

#### 📝 Submission Format

Participants must submit a CSV file named **`submission.csv`** with the following format:

```csv
id,target
1708,3
1709,1
1710,6
...
```

#### Rules

* `id` must match the provided test node IDs
* `target` must be an integer in `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`


### Step 5: Encrypt Your Submission locally 

**Make sure you have:**

1- `encrypt_submission.py`
2- `public_key.pem`
3- `Your CSV file submission.csv`

**Open CMD/terminal in the folder containing these files and run the command:**

`python encrypt_submission.py submission.csv submission.enc public_key.pem`

**This will generate two files:**

`submission.enc` → the encrypted submission

`submission.enc.key` → encryption key

Both files are required for submission. Do not submit the original CSV.


### Step 6: Place Encrypted Files in Submission Folder

Upload these files to the submission folder in your forked repo

### Step 7: Create a Pull Request

✅ Your submission will be reviewed and evaluated, and the results will be added to the leaderboard.

**Only one submission** is allowed for each participant. Subsequent submissions will be automatically rejected

## 📈 Evaluation Metric

Submissions are evaluated using:

* **Accuracy** 

Evaluation is performed on a **hidden test set** to prevent data leakage.

---

## ✅ Allowed Methods

* Any **Graph Neural Network** architecture 
* Feature preprocessing and normalization
* Hyperparameter tuning

## ❌ Not Allowed

* Using test labels
* Modifying test node IDs
* Training on test nodes

---

## 🏆 Baseline

The provided starter code implements a **2-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** as a baseline.

Participants are encouraged to improve upon this baseline using:

* Deeper architectures
* Attention mechanisms
* Regularization techniques
